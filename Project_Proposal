Project Proposal

<Sueli Yahara, Engy Samaan, Sarah Steimle>

Overview:
We will be looking at wine reviews for wines from around the world.
We will investigate any correlations between the wine characteristics,
such as review score, price, region, etc.
This investigation will help us answer our question:
"Does a more expensive wine mean a better wine?"

Dataset:
We will be using a wine review dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains wine review information
from 2017. We will also be truncating the dataset from 130,000 to a more reasonable
size for SQLite (~10k).

Visualizations:
We will be creating a number of scatter plots to display the relationships
detailed above.

Solution Architecture:
We will be using SQLAlchemy/Pandas to import the CSV file and write it to a SQL database.
Then, we will use Flask to read the database to the HTML site. Using CSS and Javascript,
we will create an interactive and creative user interface.
